# MAL Scraper

A submission for the PyJaC competition. Allows you to search up information about your favourite animes using web scraping. Just run gui.py and search!

Uses the beautifulsoup4 to scrape the MAL website requiring HTML understanding and uses pygame to create the GUI interface. There's also an additional feature of "guessing mathematical operations" given a sequence of numbers, to simulate that just run the operation_guesser.py file. Have fun!
